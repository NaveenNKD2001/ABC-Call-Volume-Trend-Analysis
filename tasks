Case Study Objectives:
Attached is the dataset of Inbound calls of a ABC company from the insurance category. Use this data to answer the following:

1.Calculate the average call time duration for all incoming calls received by agents (in each Time_Bucket).
2.Show the total volume/ number of calls coming in via charts/ graphs [Number of calls v/s Time]. You can select time in a bucket form (i.e. 1-2, 2-3, …..)
3.As you can see current abandon rate is approximately 30%. Propose a manpower plan required during each time bucket [between 9am to 9pm] to reduce the abandon rate to 10%. (i.e. You have to calculate minimum number of agents required in each time bucket so that at least 90 calls should be answered out of 100.) 
Let’s say customers also call this ABC insurance company in night but didn’t get answer as there are no agents to answer, this creates a bad customer experience for this Insurance company. Suppose every 100 calls that customer made during 9 Am to 9 Pm, customer also made 30 calls in night between interval [9 Pm to 9 Am] and distribution of those 30 calls are as follows:
4.Now propose a manpower plan required during each time bucket in a day. Maximum Abandon rate assumption would be same 10%.

Assumption: An agent work for 6 days a week; On an average total unplanned leaves per agent is 4 days a month; An agent total working hrs is 9 Hrs out of which 1.5 Hrs goes into lunch and snacks in the office. On average an agent occupied for 60% of his total actual working Hrs (i.e 60% of 7.5 Hrs) on call with customers/ users. Total days in a month is 30 days.
